Prototype 1 (core.js)
First prototype, initial server archetecture, most code. Includes absoltuely no UI, very glitchy.

Prototype 2 (c2.js)
Rewrite, designed for real use. Edit UI that did not function properlly, very glitchy.

Prototype 2 Revision 2 (AKA 2.1) (c2.1.js)
Removed Edit UI into a logging UI. Functions less glitchy than previous, but still very glitchy.

Prototype 3 (c3.js)
Beginnings of a finished project. Instead of using designMode="on" on whole document, which
disables all script-access, it clones the document onto a full-page iframe and enables 
the Edit UI.

Prototype 3 Revision 5 (c3.js)
Thourough testing, usable product.
