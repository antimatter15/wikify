<h1>Project Wikify</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Project Wikify is a bookmarklet, a simple cross-browser browser-plugin that fully enables anyone to modify or append to any attribute of any website online, in a way that everyone else using the Wikify system can see and modify as they please. It forms a community on classicly static content. A method of exchanging data, ideas, and parody with ease. It enables for Web 2.0 to truly stretch across the vast width of the entire internet, not just a minority of select sites, truly upgrading the net.
</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>
<b>Mozilla Firefox/Apple Safari:</b><br>
Drag and drop the above "Wikify" link to the bookmarks toolbar of your browser.<br>
<b>Microsoft Internet Explorer 6/7/8 (Glitchy)</b><br>
Right click on the above "Wikify" link and select "Add to Favorites".<br>
<b>Opera</b><br>
Right click on the above "Wikify" link and select "Bookmark Link".<br><br>
<a onclick="alert('Drag this link to your bookmarks toolbar!');return false" href='javascript:(function(){window.Wikify_Config={coreurl:"http://wikify.antimatter15.com/static/core.js",saveurl:"http://wikify.antimatter15.com/server/save",loadurl:"http://wikify.antimatter15.com/server/load"};if(window.Wikify){Wikify.uisave()}else{var A=document.createElement("script");A.src=Wikify_Config.coreurl;document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(A)}})()'>Wikify</a>
<br>You can use the plugin by clicking on it from your bookmarks.
</p>
<h2>Read-Only Wikify</h2>
<p>
Read-Only Wikify (or RWK) allows you to view the pages as they were intended with Project Wikify, but without write-access. It makes the pages feel more authentic, and Links and such actually work. It supports more browsers including Micosoft Internet Exploder 6+. To install, follow the install procedures for Project Wikify, but using the <a onclick="alert('Drag this link to your bookmarks toolbar!');return false" href='javascript:(function(){var%20A=document.createElement("script");A.src="http://wikify.antimatter15.com/server/rwk?url="+window.location.href;document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(A)})()'>RWK</a> link instead.
</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>
Project Wikify is designed in such a way to only store user-contributed portions of the page, It enables for better support for somewhat dynamic pages, requires less space on the server, and (hopefully) saves me from some legal isues from doing this. It has no copies of the entire web site and never will (for all you overprotective, freedom-haters). As a purely community-based system, where anyone can do anythign without being segregated by logins, everything is entirely anonymous. So if you are dissatisfied on someone's contributions to a page, you can easily "turn the tables" on them.
</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>
Project Wikify is mostly in javascript, the server is very simple. It just stores and retrieves data.
