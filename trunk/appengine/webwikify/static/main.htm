<h1>Project Wikify</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Imagine applying the public Wiki content model to all static content on the internet, relying on the community to update content, and fix simple errors. Forming a community around all content of the internet, truly "upgrading" the internet.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Project Wikify is a bookmarklet, a simple cross-browser browser-plugin that fully enables anyone to modify or append to any attribute of any website online, in a way that everyone else using the Wikify system can see and modify as they please. It forms a community on classicly static content. A method of exchanging data, ideas, and parody with ease. It enables for Web 2.0 to truly stretch across the vast width of the entire internet, not just a minority of select sites, truly upgrading the net.

<h2>Read-Only Wikify</h2>
<p>
Read-Only Wikify (or RWK) allows you to view the pages as they were intended with Project Wikify, but without write-access. It makes the pages feel more authentic, and Links and such actually work. It supports more browsers including Micosoft Internet Exploder 6+. To install, follow the install procedures for Project Wikify, but using the <a onclick="alert('Drag this link to your bookmarks toolbar!');return false" href='javascript:(function(){var%20A=document.createElement("script");A.src="http://wikify.antimatter15.com/server/rwk?url="+window.location.href;document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(A)})()'>RWK</a> link instead.
</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>
Project Wikify is designed in such a way to only store user-contributed portions of the page, It enables for better support for somewhat dynamic pages, requires less space on the server, and (hopefully) saves me from some legal isues from doing this. It has no copies of the entire web site and never will (for all you overprotective, freedom-haters). As a purely community-based system, where anyone can do anythign without being segregated by logins, everything is entirely anonymous. So if you are dissatisfied on someone's contributions to a page, you can easily "turn the tables" on them.
</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>
Project Wikify is mostly in javascript, the server is very simple, and it just stores and retrieves data. Only two attributes are required, the URL of the page, and the data (patch) from the client. A PHP flat-file reference implementation is available from google code. <a href="http://wikify.googlecode.com/">http://wikify.googlecode.com/</a>
</p>
<h2>Wikify Bookmarklet/Userscript</h2>
<p>
Project Wikify (RWK) is available as a userscript, allowing it to automatically execute on page load. On Firefox, you must install GreaseMonkey, and may work on other platforms such as Opera, but only Fx/GM are officially supported.<br>
To install, visit <a href="/static/wikify.user.js">this</a>. A pop-up should appear prompting you whether you are sure you want to install the userscript, click Continue, and you should be able to read the Wikified versions of any site seamlessly.<br>

<h2>Wikify Browser</h2>
<p>
A crude Wikify browser which does the equivalent of running the RWK bookmarklet on every page load is available <a href="http://wikify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/browser/Wikify/bin/Release/Wikify.exe">here</a> (Note, may require .NET 3.5 runtime, though code should be compilable in VS 2003).<br>
